This project is a simple Java-based image editor that allows users to perform various operations on images such as adjusting brightness, contrast, flipping, rotating, and applying filters. It uses the Swing library for the graphical interface and handles image manipulation by converting images into 2D color arrays for easy pixel-level operations.
